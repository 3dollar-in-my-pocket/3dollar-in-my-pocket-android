## Android skills

**Android skills** are a dedicated repository of **AI-optimized, modular instructions** and
resources, to help LLMs better understand and execute specific patterns that follow the best
practices and guidance on Android development
from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com).

Android skills follow the [open-standard agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) - markdown
files (SKILL.md) that provide a technical specification of a task, and **ground LLMs** with
information on specialized domains and workflows.

Our Android skill development focuses on **use cases and workflows where evaluations show LLMs
underperform**.
We aren't prioritizing well-established areas where LLMs are already proficient, such
as basic Jetpack Compose best practices.

To learn more, read the official documentation:

- [Android skills](https://developer.android.com/tools/agents/android-skills)
- [Android CLI](https://developer.android.com/tools/agents/android-cli)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/gemini/skills)

### Install Android skills

Use Android CLI to install a specific skill into the current directory:

```
android skills add --skill=r8-analyzer --project=.
```

Use Android CLI to install all Android skills to directories for all detected agents:

```
android skills add --all
```

If you don't have any existing agent directories and don't specify particular agents, the skills
will be installed for Gemini and Antigravity at `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`.

**Options:**

- `--all` - Add all Android skills. If omitted (and `--skill` isn't specified), only the
  `android-cli` skill will be installed.
- `--agent` - A comma-separated list of agents to install the skill for. If omitted, the skill will
  be installed for all detected agents.
- `--skill` - Specific skill that you want to install. If omitted (and `--all` isn't specified),
  only the `android-cli` skill will be installed.
- `--project` - Path to a project root in which to install the skills.
